This project aims to understand the dynamics of basketball performance at the player and team
levels using play-by-play data from NBA games. The analysis seeks to uncover the underlying
factors contributing to successful basketball strategies by examining the interactions between
players on the court. Focusing on the Los Angeles Lakers, this project aims to help the
organization identify potential trade targets based on the efficiency metric, calculating
plus/minus scores along with star players from the organization to assess the impact of critical
role players and lastly, clusters players from around the league to find players with
complementing playing styles.
